# Welcome to Auditbeat 7.4.1

Audit the activities of users and processes on your system.

## Getting Started

To get started with Auditbeat, you need to set up Elasticsearch on
your localhost first. After that, start Auditbeat with:

     ./auditbeat -c auditbeat.yml -e

This will start Auditbeat and send the data to your Elasticsearch
instance. To load the dashboards for Auditbeat into Kibana, run:

    ./auditbeat setup -e
